                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2020, NutriBite was born out of a deep-seated desire to address the growing need for 
                    accessible and credible nutrition information in a world filled with conflicting advice. Our founders 
                    recognized that many individuals struggle to navigate the overwhelming amount of dietary information 
                    available today, often leading to confusion and frustration. This realization sparked the creation of 
                    a platform dedicated to simplifying nutrition, offering clear guidance and practical solutions. Over 
                    the past few years, we have built a reputation for excellence, driven by our commitment to quality and 
                    integrity. From our early days of sharing basic nutrition tips, we have evolved into a comprehensive 
                    resource that caters to diverse dietary needs and preferences, all while fostering a supportive 
                    community that encourages positive lifestyle changes.</p>

                <h2>Recipe Collection</h2>
                <p>At NutriBite, the process of collecting recipes is a thoughtful blend of collaboration, creativity, and 
                    research. We work closely with a network of experienced nutritionists, chefs, and culinary experts who 
                    help us curate a diverse selection of recipes that are not only delicious but also nutritionally balanced. 
                    Each recipe undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets our high standards for taste, health benefits, 
                    and ease of preparation. We prioritize whole, unprocessed ingredients and aim to cater to various 
                    dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and more. Additionally, we actively 
                    encourage our community members to share their own favorite recipes, creating a vibrant exchange of 
                    culinary ideas and inspiration. This collaborative approach allows us to continually enrich our recipe 
                    collection, ensuring it reflects the tastes and preferences of our audience while promoting a culture of 
                    healthy eating.</p>
